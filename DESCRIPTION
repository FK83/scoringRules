Description: Dictionary-like reference for computing scoring rules in a wide
    range of situations. Covers both parametric forecast distributions (such as
    mixtures of Gaussians) and distributions generated via simulation. Further 
    details can be found in the package vignettes <doi:10.18637/jss.v090.i12>, 
    <doi:10.18637/jss.v110.i08>.
