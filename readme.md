# scoringRules 

An R package to compute scoring rules for fixed (parametric) and simulated forecast distributions. Authored by Alexander Jordan (Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies, HITS), Fabian Kr√ºger (Heidelberg University) and Sebastian Lerch (HITS and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, KIT), with contributions from Maximiliane Graeter (KIT). 

## Highlights
  - Coherent, dictionary-like reference for computing scoring rules in a wide range of situations
  - Previously unavailable closed-form expressions of the CRPS for many parametric distributions
  - Efficient implementation thanks to R/Rcpp 
  - Whenever more than one implementation variant exists, we offer statistically principled default choices
  
## Installation

CRAN version:
```r
install.packages("scoringRules")
```

Development version (GitHub):
```r
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("FK83/scoringRules")
```

## Background

Scoring rules are functions S(F, y) which evaluate the accuracy of a forecast distribution F, given that an outcome y was observed. The **scoringRules** package contains functions to compute scoring rules, for a variety of distributions F that come up in applied work, and two popular choices of S. Two main classes of distributions are

  - Parametric distributions like normal, t, and gamma. For example, most weather forecasts (which apply statistical postprocessing to physical models) take such a form. 
  - Distributions that are not known analytically, but are indirectly described through a sample of simulaton draws. For example, Bayesian forecasts produced via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) take this form. 

The scoring rules we cover are the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS; Matheson and Winkler, 1976) and the logarithmic score (Good, 1952). The package further provides functions to compute the multivariate energy and variogram scores for forecast distributions given by discrete samples.
